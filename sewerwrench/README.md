# RV Sewer Wrench

Tool for removing Valterra style RV sewer caps.

Printing:

I printed in PETG with 50% infill and 12 walls for strength, but if you print in ABS then you
can more easily sand the endges and handle to give a more comfortable grip.

Will fit on a 150mmx230mm (6"x9") bed if rotated.
